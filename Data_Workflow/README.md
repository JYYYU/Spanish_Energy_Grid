The Data_Workflow folder contains the three notebooks used for data cleaning and feature engineering. Follow the notebooks in the order below for a smooth data preprocessing workflow:

1. Energy_Data.ipynb – This notebook handles the preprocessing of the energy dataset.
2. Weather_Features.ipynb – This notebook focuses on cleaning and preprocessing the weather-related data.
3. Feature_Engineer.ipynb – This notebook performs feature engineering by combining and transforming the preprocessed datasets.

Additionally, the Python file 'DataHelper,' which is utilized in each notebook, holds all the complex code that I removed from the notebooks to present a cleaner and more streamlined view for the audience.
